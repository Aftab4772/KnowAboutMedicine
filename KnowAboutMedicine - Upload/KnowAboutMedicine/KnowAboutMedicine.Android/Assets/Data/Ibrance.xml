      Ibrance (palbociclib) is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body.
      Ibrance is used in men and women to treat HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
      In postmenopausal women, Ibrance is given in combination with a hormonal medicine such as letrozole (Femara). In others, Ibrance is given together with fulvestrant (Faslodex).
