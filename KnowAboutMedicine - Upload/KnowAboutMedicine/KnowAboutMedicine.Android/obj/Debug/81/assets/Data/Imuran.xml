      Imuran weakens your body&#39;s immune system, to help keep it from &quot;rejecting&quot; a transplanted organ such as a kidney. Organ rejection happens when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it.
      Imuran is used to prevent your body from rejecting a transplanted kidney. This medicine is also used to treat symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
      Imuran may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.

      Your doctor will perform blood tests to make sure you do not have conditions that would prevent you from safely using Imuran.
      Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.
      When given for kidney transplant, Imuran is usually given right before or on the day of transplant. For rheumatoid arthritis, this medicine is taken on a daily basis.
      It may take up to 8 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using Imuran as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms have not improved after 12 weeks of use.
      Take with food if Imuran upsets your stomach.
      You may not be able to continue taking other arthritis medications together with Imuran. Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor&#39;s advice.
      Imuran affects your immune system. You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections. Your doctor will need to examine you on a regular basis.
