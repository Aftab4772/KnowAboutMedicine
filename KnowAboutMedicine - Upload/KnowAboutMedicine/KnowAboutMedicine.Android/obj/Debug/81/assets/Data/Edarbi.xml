    Edarbi (azilsartan) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (sometimes called an ARB). Azilsartan keeps blood vessels from narrowing, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow.
    Edarbi is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Your doctor may prescribe other medicines for you to take along with Edarbi to treat your high blood pressure.
