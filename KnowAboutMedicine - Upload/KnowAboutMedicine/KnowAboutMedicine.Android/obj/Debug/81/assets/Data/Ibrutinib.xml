    <Info>
      Ibrutinib can make it easier for you to bleed. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have easy bruising, unusual bleeding, or any bleeding that will not stop. You may also have bleeding on the inside of your body, such as in your stomach or intestines, or in your brain.
      Call your doctor at once if you have signs of bleeding inside your body, such as: dizziness, weakness, confusion, headache, speech problems, black or bloody stools, pink or brown urine, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.
